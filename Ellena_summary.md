## Meeting Transcription and AI Summary Pipeline

One of Ell-ena's most powerful features is its automated meeting transcription and summarization system. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

### 1. Meeting Recording and Transcription

When a user schedules a meeting with a Google Meet URL, Ell-ena's system:

1. **Monitors for meeting activity**: The system detects when a meeting starts and ends via the Google Meet integration.

2. **Captures audio**: Using the Vexa API, Ell-ena captures the meeting audio in real-time.

3. **Generates transcription**: The Vexa API processes the audio and generates a detailed text transcription of the entire meeting conversation, including speaker identification.

4. **Stores raw transcription**: The raw transcription is stored in the Supabase database in the `meetings` table, linked to the specific meeting record.

### 2. AI Summary Generation

Once a meeting has a transcription, an automated pipeline processes it:

1. **Scheduled processing**: A PostgreSQL cron job (`process_unsummarized_meetings`) runs every minute to check for meetings with transcriptions but no summaries.

2. **Edge Function invocation**: For each meeting needing processing, the system calls the `summarize-transcription` Edge Function.

3. **AI processing**: The Edge Function uses the Gemini API to:
   - Analyze the meeting transcription
   - Extract key topics, decisions, and action items
   - Generate a structured summary with follow-up tasks
   - Format the output as a structured JSON object

4. **Summary storage**: The AI-generated summary is stored in the `meeting_summary_json` column of the `meetings` table.

### 3. Vector Embedding Generation

After a meeting has been summarized, another pipeline creates semantic embeddings:

1. **Scheduled embedding generation**: A PostgreSQL cron job (`process_meetings_missing_embeddings`) runs every 5 minutes to check for meetings with summaries but no embeddings.

2. **Edge Function invocation**: For each meeting needing embeddings, the system calls the `generate-embeddings` Edge Function.

3. **Vector creation**: The Edge Function uses Gemini's embedding-001 model to convert the meeting summary text into a 768-dimensional vector.

4. **Vector storage**: The embedding vector is stored in the `summary_embedding` column (using PostgreSQL's vector extension) of the `meetings` table.

### 4. Semantic Search and Retrieval

When a user asks a question about past meetings:

1. **Query detection**: The AI service detects if the user's query is meeting-related using keyword analysis.

2. **Query embedding**: If meeting-related, the system generates a vector embedding for the user's query using the `get-embedding` Edge Function.

3. **Vector similarity search**: The system performs a cosine similarity search against all meeting summary embeddings to find the most relevant meetings.

4. **Context enrichment**: The relevant meeting information is included as context in the prompt to the AI, enabling it to provide accurate, contextual responses.

5. **Response generation**: The Gemini model generates a response that incorporates the relevant meeting information, creating the impression of "memory" about past discussions.

## Task and Ticket Management

Ell-ena provides sophisticated task and ticket management capabilities:

### 1. Natural Language Task Creation

Users can create tasks using natural language commands through the chat interface:

1. **Intent recognition**: The AI service recognizes when a user is trying to create a task or ticket.

2. **Function calling**: The AI generates a structured function call to `create_task` or `create_ticket` with appropriate parameters.

3. **Parameter extraction**: The system extracts relevant details like title, description, due date, priority, and assignee from the user's natural language input.

4. **Task creation**: The Supabase service creates the task/ticket record in the database with the extracted parameters.

5. **Real-time updates**: The UI updates in real-time to show the newly created task/ticket.

### 2. Contextual Enrichment

Ell-ena enriches tasks with contextual information:

1. **Team member awareness**: The system understands team member names and can assign tasks appropriately.

2. **Date interpretation**: Natural language date references like "tomorrow" or "next week" are automatically converted to proper date formats.

3. **Priority inference**: For tickets, the system infers appropriate priority levels based on the context of the request.

4. **Category assignment**: Tickets are automatically categorized based on their content.

### 3. Meeting-to-Task Conversion

Ell-ena can automatically generate tasks from meeting summaries:

1. **Action item extraction**: The AI identifies action items and follow-up tasks from meeting transcriptions.

2. **Structured data creation**: These are stored as structured data in the meeting summary JSON.

3. **One-click conversion**: Users can convert these items to formal tasks or tickets with a single click from the meeting details screen.

4. **Automatic assignment**: The system attempts to assign tasks to the appropriate team members based on the meeting context.

## Authentication and Team Management

Ell-ena implements a sophisticated multi-account login system:

### 1. Team-Based Authentication

1. **Team creation**: Users can create new teams with unique team codes.

2. **Team joining**: Users can join existing teams using team codes.

3. **Role-based access**: Users are assigned roles (admin or member) that determine their permissions.

4. **Multi-team support**: Users can belong to multiple teams and switch between them.

### 2. Row-Level Security

1. **Data isolation**: Each team's data is completely isolated using Supabase's Row-Level Security policies.

2. **Permission enforcement**: Database policies ensure users can only access data from their own teams.

3. **Role-based permissions**: Certain actions (like approving tasks or deleting meetings) are restricted to admin users.

## User Interface Components

   - User joins the meeting via the stored URL
   - Vexa API captures the audio and generates a transcription
   - Transcription is stored in the database

3. **Automated Processing**:
   - Cron job detects the meeting has a transcription but no summary
   - `summarize-transcription` Edge Function is called
   - Gemini API analyzes the transcription and generates a structured summary
   - Summary is stored in the database

4. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Cron job detects the meeting has a summary but no embedding
   - `generate-embeddings` Edge Function is called
   - Gemini embedding-001 model creates a vector embedding
   - Embedding is stored in the database

5. **User Query**:
   - User asks "What did we decide about the marketing budget last week?"
   - System detects this is a meeting-related query
   - `get-embedding` Edge Function creates an embedding for the query
