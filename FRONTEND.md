3. **Start the Emulator**:
   - In Android Studio, click on the AVD Manager and start your emulator.
   - Alternatively, you can start it from the command line:
   ```
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   ```
   - To list available emulators:
   ```
   flutter emulators
   ```

### iOS Simulator (macOS Only)

1. **Install Xcode**:
   - Ensure Xcode is installed as described in the Flutter installation steps.

2. **Open the Simulator**:
   - Run the following command in Terminal:
   ```bash
   open -a Simulator
   ```
   - Alternatively, you can use Flutter to launch the simulator:
   ```bash
   flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator
   ```

3. **Select Device Type**:
   - In the Simulator, go to File > Open Simulator and select the desired device.

## Cloning and Setting Up the Ell-ena Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Ell-ena
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to get all the required packages:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials (as described in the BACKEND.md guide):
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>
   VEXA_API_KEY=<YOUR_VEXA_API_KEY>
   ```

## Connecting to the Supabase Backend

The Ell-ena project is already configured to connect to Supabase. The connection is established in the `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` file.

1. **Ensure Backend is Set Up**:
   - Make sure you have completed all the steps in the BACKEND.md guide.
   - Your Supabase project should be up and running with all the required tables and functions.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct Supabase URL and anon key.
   - These values can be found in your Supabase dashboard under Settings > API.

3. **Initialize Supabase**:
   - The project already initializes Supabase in the `main.dart` file through the `SupabaseService().initialize()` method.
   - This method loads the environment variables and sets up the Supabase client.

## Running the Application

1. **Check Available Devices**:
   - Run the following command to see all available devices:
   ```
   flutter devices
   ```

2. **Run the App**:
   - To run on all connected devices:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```
   - To run on a specific device:
   ```
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```
   - To run in release mode (for better performance):
   ```
   flutter run --release
   ```

3. **Debug Mode Features**:
   - While the app is running in debug mode, you can:
     - Press `r` to hot-reload the app (apply code changes without restarting).
     - Press `R` to hot-restart the app (completely restart the app).
     - Press `q` to quit the app.
     - Press `v` to print the Flutter framework version.
